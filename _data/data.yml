career-profile:
    title: Intro
    summary: |

        Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration at Korea Tech University and have engaged in extensive research in anomaly detection, physics-based machine learning, and optimization. 

        My dedication lies in developing robust models for extrapolation. Integrating AI technologies to construct innovative business models is the core focus of my ongoing research. 
        
        I have participated in various competitions and collaborated on projects with the government and corporations. Each experience has been pivotal, sharpening my practical skills and enriching my theoretical knowledge.

        AI's potential to revolutionize traditional business strategies fuels my passion. I am steadfast in my commitment to enhancing my expertise and making innovative contributions to this field.

        details: |
            In the laboratory, my primary focus has been on studying anomaly detection, natural language processing, and physics-based machine learning. I delved into diverse models for anomaly detection, including distance-based, density-based, and model-based approaches. Utilizing Streamlit, I transformed my knowledge into an educational tool that I subsequently deployed for broader access and learning.

            In the realm of natural language processing, I specialized in trade deal matching. By employing NLP techniques for preprocessing and scoring the results of trade deal matches, I effectively visualized the data using Tableau to enhance CRM practices.

            My journey in physics-based machine learning was marked by constructing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to simulate the hysteresis curve, utilizing the Bouc-Wen differential equation. Additionally, I engaged in developing a physics-based simulator for solar power generation.

            These diverse research experiences have equipped me with a comprehensive skill set and an innovative approach to tackling complex problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
